The AntTweakBar UI can be used to manipulate the values for the spirograph.

WASD will move the camera up down left and right
QE will zoom the camera in or out
SHIFT while pressed will slow the cameras movement for more pricies control
SPACE will switch modes between bezier curve interaction and spirograph
V will toggle the bezier nodes being visable and invisible
RIGHT_CLICK will add more bezier points to the curve, adding 3 extra will create a new curve. 

The UI offers many values that can be tweaked, if by tweaking them you cannot see any effects it is likely that you have made the spirogram to big to see and should zoom out.

Some spirographs require a larget T value then others. Keep this in mind. 

Adding a new spirogram will not be immediately visible because it copies all the settings from your previous one. It should become visible when you change some of the settings to differentiate it from the other one.
